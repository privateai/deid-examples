# Introduction

This repository contains examples that showcase how to use the Private AI REST API, for both Python and JS. The API allows for PII to be found in text and then replaced with redaction markers or synthetic PII. The system supports over [50 entity types](https://docs.private-ai.com/entities/), such as Credit Card information and Social Security numbers across [50 languages](https://docs.private-ai.com/languages/). The documentation, including the API reference can be found [here](https://docs.private-ai.com/introduction).
