I love Starbucks and I'm one of the ones that would always be pissed off for tooo much ice and no foam in my drinks but I would always watch them like a hawk and tell them exactly how I like it. But I went in tonight to get a new drink. I kind of knew it was a waste of time just because how much different can it really be from what they have already. So whatever I tried it and omg never again will I try something new from them again. Very disgusting. The drink was horrible. The service was awesome. I got the youth berry and the caramel one. Horrible and $5 each - waste of money. I could have gone next door and got a frozen lemonade from Wendy's for $3 and it would have tasted better.,['No Images']

It's popular especially at the end of each year where they give a pamphlet to a consumer and fills it up with 18 stickers (and buy 18 coffees from them) to get a planner. Imagine that, 18 coffees! It's like you are giving them your salary because it's high priced. But I guess it's only practiced in the Philippines and not in other countries as here in Malaysia, it's not that appealing. Besides that it's quite expensive, locals here prefer their local coffee shops. You could only see foreigners as their customers, and what's more, they only have a few frappucinos. Well maybe they don't have sweet tooth as Filipinos. Even though its like that, I still like Starbucks especially its Vanilla Frapp. At least its selling here.

So the next day when I went back I ordered the same thing but this time it was a different barista and I could tell by his name tag he was the manager.

How long will it stay fresh? Once roasted, coffee begins to lose its flavor the longer it is exposed to air and moisture. We recommend buying your coffee weekly, storing it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place and grinding it just before brewing.

Terri,"Indianapolis, IN","Reviewed April 10, 2009",N/A,"I have recently spoken with many Starbucks customers and have come to the same conclusion and that is that Starbucks has recently (since 4/1/09) began making their coffee weaker. I have had problems with Starbucks recently and have been in contact with their customer service group concerning consistently receiving cold coffee from their stores and the inability to receive decaf coffee at certain times of the day. To each, they reply they are trying to cut costs during tough economic times. Apparently now, a new way to cut cost is to make weaker coffee, which cost their customers more money. More money is needed because now it is necessary to pay for a shot of espresso to put in the coffee, so it tastes like it did before the decision to make weaker coffee was made. What used to be an unreasonable price for coffee is now made more unreasonable. One must ask, is Starbucks losing their customers because of the tough economic times or are they losing their customer because they keep making decisions to weaken their once impeccable brand?",['No Images']
