# Example script to illustrate how to make API calls to the Private AI Docker
# container to deidentify a text using the unique PII markers feature (default).
#
# To use this script, please start the Docker container locally, as per the
# instructions at https://private-ai.com/docs/installation.
#
# In order to use the API key issued by Private AI, you can run the script as
# `API_KEY=<your key here> python process_file_uri.py` or you can define a
# `.env` file which has the line`API_KEY=<your key here>`.
